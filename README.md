# **End-to-End MLOps Plan**

## **Phase 1: Local Development and Model Validation**
### **Objective**  
Set up local infrastructure to simulate real-world streaming, develop the model, and validate it on small datasets.

### **Steps**  
1. **Set Up Kafka Locally**  
   - Install Kafka locally (or use Docker) to simulate real-time streaming.  
   - Create topics:  
     - `input-stream`: For incoming raw data.  
     - `output-stream`: For model predictions.

2. **Data Preparation**  
   - Collect small sample data (CSV or JSON format).  
   - Use a Kafka producer to stream this data to the `input-stream` topic.

3. **Model Development**  
   - Use libraries like **scikit-learn** or **TensorFlow** to develop the model locally.  
   - Simulate real-time data ingestion from Kafka using a Kafka consumer.  
   - Preprocess the incoming raw data as required.

4. **Track Experiments with MLflow**  
   - Use MLflow locally to track:  
     - Model parameters  
     - Metrics (accuracy, latency)  
     - Artifacts (trained models)  
   - Save the **best-performing model** to the local MLflow registry.

5. **Validate Inference**  
   - Perform inference locally using the Kafka consumer.  
   - Log the latency and metrics for predictions.  
   - Store results for validation.

## **Phase 2: Move to Azure Infrastructure**
### **Objective**  
Scale your pipeline to the cloud using Azure services.

### **Steps**  
1. **Data Storage Setup**  
   - Upload all **raw data** to **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**.  
   - Organize data into layers:  
     - **Bronze**: Raw data  
     - **Silver**: Processed data  
     - **Gold**: Refined, model-ready data  

2. **Set Up Event Hub**  
   - Create an **Azure Event Hub** instance.  
   - Replace the local Kafka setup with Event Hub (Kafka-compatible).  
   - Stream unseen data to Event Hub as **real-time input**.

3. **Set Up Azure Databricks**  
   - Create a **Databricks Workspace** connected to Azure Data Lake Storage and Event Hub.  
   - Use **PySpark** to process streaming data from Event Hub:  
     - Cleanse and preprocess incoming data.  
     - Write preprocessed data to the **Silver** layer of ADLS.  

4. **Model Training in Databricks**  
   - Train the model on preprocessed data in Databricks.  
   - Integrate **MLflow** for:  
     - Experiment tracking  
     - Hyperparameter tuning  
     - Model evaluation  
   - Save the **best model** to the MLflow Model Registry.  

5. **Model Versioning**  
   - Use MLflowâ€™s stages:  
     - **Development** â†’ **Staging** â†’ **Production**

## **Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions**
### **Objective**  
Automate the deployment process to ensure reliable, scalable, and versioned model delivery.

### **Steps**  
1. **Version Control**  
   - Store your model training, preprocessing, and deployment scripts in **GitHub**.  

2. **GitHub Actions Pipeline**  
   - **Trigger**: When a model reaches the **Staging** stage in MLflow or when code changes are pushed to GitHub.  
   - **Steps**:
     - Pull the model from MLflow Registry.  
     - Containerize the model using **Docker**.  
     - Push the Docker image to **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.  
     - Deploy the containerized model to **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.  

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Structure**  
   - **Model Validation**: Run basic tests before deployment.  
   - **Containerization**: Package the model and dependencies into a Docker container.  
   - **Deployment**: Deploy to AKS.  

---

## **Phase 4: Model Deployment and Serving on AKS**
### **Objective**  
Serve the trained model for real-time predictions at scale.

### **Steps**  
1. **AKS Setup**  
   - Set up **Azure Kubernetes Service** for scalable model deployment.  

2. **Deploy the Model**  
   - Pull the Docker image from **Azure Container Registry** (ACR).  
   - Deploy the containerized model to AKS.  
   - Expose the AKS endpoint as a **REST API**.  

3. **Integration with Event Hub**  
   - Route preprocessed data from Databricks to the AKS endpoint for real-time inference.  

4. **Results Streaming**  
   - Send model predictions back to Event Hub.  
   - Store predictions in **Azure Data Lake Storage** for further analysis.

## **Phase 5: Monitoring, Retraining, and Governance**
### **Objective**  
Monitor the pipeline, automate retraining, and ensure compliance.

### **Steps**  
1. **Monitoring**  
   - Use **Azure Monitor** and **Application Insights** to track:  
     - API latency and request success rates.  
     - Resource usage and errors.  
     - Model performance (e.g., drift in accuracy).  

2. **Real-Time Dashboards**  
   - Use **Power BI** or **Grafana** to visualize:  
     - Incoming raw data (streaming from Event Hub).  
     - Model predictions and performance metrics.  

3. **Automated Retraining**  
   - Use **Databricks** to periodically check for model drift:  
     - If drift is detected â†’ Retrain the model using new data.  
     - Register the new model version in MLflow.  
   - Trigger the **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline** to deploy the updated model to AKS.  

4. **Governance and Security**  
   - Use **Azure Policy** and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to ensure:  
     - Only authorized users can access data and models.  
     - Policies enforce security and compliance standards.  
   - Use **MLflow Model Registry** to control the promotion of models between stages.
